# Project Overview

Last month, our team set out to build **Performlytics** - a modern analytics dashboard for SaaS businesses. What started as a simple admin panel evolved into a full-featured data visualization tool built with:

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts
- Vite

## The Challenge

Our client needed:

1. **Real-time data updates** (every 30 seconds)
2. **Customizable widgets**
3. **Mobile-responsive design**
4. **Exportable reports**

Here's how we solved the key technical challenges:

## Implementing Real-Time Updates

We used React Query with WebSockets:

## Performance Optimizations

The dashboard needed to handle 10,000+ data points without lag. Our solution:

1. **Virtualized lists** for large datasets
2. **Memoized components** with `React.memo`
3. **Debounced filters** (300ms delay)
