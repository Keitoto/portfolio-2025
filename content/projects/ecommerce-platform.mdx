## The Migration Challenge

Our client's PHP-based e-commerce site was struggling with:

- 4+ second load times  
- Poor mobile conversion rates  
- Complex checkout flows  

We chose **Next.js** for its:
1. Built-in SSR/SSG support  
2. Image optimization  
3. API routes  

## Performance Results

Here's a comparison of key metrics before and after our Next.js migration:

| Metric       | Before  | After   |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Load Time    | 4.2s    | 1.1s    |
| Conversions  | 1.8%    | 3.5%    |
| SEO Traffic  | 10K/mo  | 28K/mo  |

## Lessons Learned

### Successes
- ✔️ **Next.js Image component** reduced banner image sizes by 75%  
- ✔️ **Dynamic imports** for heavy checkout components improved initial load  

### Challenges
- ⚠️ Legacy session management required custom middleware  
- ⚠️ ISR cache invalidation needed careful planning
